<p>During the pandemic, I spent the majority of my time playing video games.
    The game I was playing the most at the time was probably League
    of Legends. I would also go skate at the park by my house sometimes, 
    if it was empty (I wanted to make sure I was social distancing). I made
    sure to spend a lot of time with my cat, Sona, too.</p>
<h3>Three things I like:</h3>

        <li>Video Games</li>
        <li>Reading Books</li>
